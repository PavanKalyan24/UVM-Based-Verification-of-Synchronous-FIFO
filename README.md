# UVM-Based-Verification-of-Synchronous-FIFO
UVM-based verification of a parameterized synchronous FIFO using SystemVerilog. Implemented sequences, driver, agent, environment, and interface-based DUT integration. Verified data integrity, full/empty behavior, overflow, underflow, and simultaneous read/write using constrained-random stimulus and scoreboard checking.
